Subrosa is an IRC daemon written in Clojure.

It's event driven, backed by the Netty server framework.

It's also nowhere near complete and totally unsuitable for anything
other than hacking on.

Self-signed Keystores (for SSL) can be created with the mkks.sh shell
script provided in the release tarballs (and in pkg/bin/ in the source
distribution).

This fork contains the non-rfc command "/catchup", which is enabled when logging
is enabled.

Examples:

/catchup #foo
send all the messages that occurred before you logged in for the #foo room

/catchup #foo 1d
send all the messages in the last day

/catchup #foo 1w
send the messages for the last week

/catchup #foo 1d2h17m1s
send the messages for the last 1 day, 2 hours, 17 minutes and 1 second

Warning: sending the messages for the last week will spam your client with
many many messages, be warned the catchup command has not been tested in
high-traffic setups.
